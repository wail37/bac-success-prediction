# 🧠 BAC Success Rate Prediction in Algeria (2013–2025)

This is a Data Science project that analyzes the historical success rates of the Algerian Baccalaureate exam and uses machine learning to predict future rates for the years 2024 and 2025.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of BAC success rates from 2013 to 2023.
- 🤖 Building a linear regression model to predict success rates for upcoming years.
- 🌐 Interactive web application using Streamlit for visualization and user input.
