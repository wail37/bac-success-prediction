# 🧠 BAC Success Rate Prediction in Algeria (2013–2025)

This project analyzes the historical success rates of the Algerian Baccalaureate exam and uses machine learning to predict future rates (2024 and 2025). It also includes an interactive web app built with Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of BAC success rates from 2013 to 2023.
- 🤖 Linear Regression model to forecast success rates.
- 🌐 Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.
- 📈 Designed to support educational decision-making and planning in Algeria.
